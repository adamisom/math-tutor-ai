## Test Problem 1: Simple Linear Equation

**Problem:** `2x + 5 = 13`

**Type:** Algebra (Simple)

**Full Conversation:**
```
User: 2x + 5 = 13

Claude: Hey there! Great, let's work through this problem together: **2x + 5 = 13**

Let me start with a question to get us thinking: **What do we know from this equation, and what are we trying to find?**

Take a moment to look at it - what do you notice? 🤔

User: we know that there's 2 x's and we ware trying to find x

Claude: Excellent observation! Yes, we have 2x (which means 2 times x), and our goal is to figure out what value x has.

So here's my next question: **What's happening to x in this equation? What operations do you see being done to it?**

Look at the left side - what mathematical steps are being applied to x?

User: it's being multiplied by 2 and 5 is added

Claude: Perfect! You've identified both operations exactly right - x is being multiplied by 2, and then 5 is being added to that result.

Now here's an important thinking question: **To get x by itself, what do you think we need to do with these operations?**

Think about it this way - if someone put on socks and then shoes, how would they undo that to get back to bare feet? 🤔

User: umm that's kind of hard. if someone has socks and shoes on they need to take shoes off first

Claude: Exactly! That's perfect reasoning! You take off the shoes first (the last thing that went on), and then the socks.

So let's apply that same logic to our equation: **2x + 5 = 13**

You said x is multiplied by 2 first, and then 5 is added. So which operation should we undo first - the multiplying by 2, or the adding 5?

User: the multiplying by 2?

Claude: Hmm, let's think about this together. Remember your great example with the shoes and socks?

The socks went on **first**, then the shoes went on **second**.

But you take off the shoes **first**, then the socks **second**.

So in our equation:

- x is multiplied by 2 **first**

- Then 5 is added **second**

Using that same "undo in reverse order" logic, which operation should we undo first? 🤔

User: ohh ok let's undo add 5

Claude: Yes! Exactly right! We need to undo the "add 5" first.

So here's our equation: **2x + 5 = 13**

Now, my next question: **How do we undo adding 5? What operation gets rid of that +5 on the left side?**

And remember - whatever we do to one side of the equation, we have to do to the other side too! ⚖️

User: oh if we subtract 5 that undoes adding 5

Claude: Perfect! Yes, subtracting 5 undoes adding 5!

So now, **go ahead and subtract 5 from both sides of the equation. What do you get?**

Remember:

- Left side: 2x + 5 - 5 = ?

- Right side: 13 - 5 = ?

What does your equation look like now? ✏️

User: 13 - 5 = 8!

Claude: Great! So the right side gives us 8.

Now let's look at the left side too: **2x + 5 - 5 = ?**

What happens when you have +5 and then -5? What are you left with on the left side? 🤔

User: oh, 2x!

Claude: Exactly! The +5 and -5 cancel out, leaving us with just 2x!

So now our equation is: **2x = 8**

We're getting so close! Now, here's the next question: **What operation is still being done to x, and how can we undo it?**

Look at what's happening to x now. 👀

User: ohh if we divide by 2 that will undo the multiply by 2

Claude: YES! Perfect reasoning! Dividing by 2 will undo multiplying by 2.

So go ahead - **divide both sides by 2. What do you get?**

- Left side: 2x ÷ 2 = ?

- Right side: 8 ÷ 2 = ?

What's your answer? 🎯

User: 2x divided by 2 is 1. 8 divided by 2 is 4!

Claude: You're SO close! Let me ask you this: **What is 2x divided by 2?**

Think about it carefully - if you have 2 times x, and you divide that whole thing by 2, what cancels out? What are you left with?

It's just like how 2 times 3 divided by 2 gives you back 3! 

What do you get when the 2's cancel out? 🤔

User: 2x divided by 2 is x!

Claude: EXACTLY! Yes! The 2's cancel out and you're left with just **x**!

And you already figured out that 8 ÷ 2 = 4, so:

**x = 4**

Awesome job! 🎉 You solved it! You used inverse operations perfectly - first subtracting 5 from both sides, then dividing both sides by 2.

Now, here's a final thinking question to make sure our answer works: **If x = 4, can you plug it back into the original equation (2x + 5 = 13) and check if it's true?**

What do you get when you substitute 4 for x?

User: wow! so x is 4?

Claude: Yes! You did it! **x = 4** is your solution! 🎉

You worked through that whole problem yourself using great logical thinking - undoing operations in reverse order, just like taking off shoes and socks!

Now, let's double-check your answer to make sure it works. **Can you substitute x = 4 back into the original equation 2x + 5 = 13?**

What do you get when you replace x with 4 and calculate the left side? Does it equal 13? Give it a try! ✓

User: oh okay... 2 * 4 = 8... + 5 = 13! yay!

Claude: YES! Perfect! 🎉🎉🎉

You just proved that x = 4 is correct! When you plug it back in:

- 2 × 4 = 8

- 8 + 5 = 13 ✓

It works! You solved the entire problem from start to finish, and you understood every step along the way. That's fantastic work!

You used:

1. Subtraction to undo addition

2. Division to undo multiplication

3. Checked your answer by plugging it back in

Great job! You should feel really proud of yourself! 🌟

## Test Problem 2: Distributive Property (Parentheses)

**Problem:** `3(x - 4) = 15`

**Type:** Algebra (Distributive Property)

**Full Conversation:**
```
User: 3(x - 4) = 15

Claude: Great! Let's work through this together! 🎯

First, let's look at what we have here. Can you tell me:

**What do we see on the left side of the equation?**

Take a look at that 3(x - 4) - what's happening there?

User: 3 is being multiplied by an expression in parentheses

Claude: Exactly! You've identified the key structure here! 👏

So we have 3 multiplied by the entire expression (x - 4), and that whole thing equals 15.

Now, here's my next question for you:

**What could we do to "undo" that multiplication by 3?**

Think about what operation is the opposite of multiplication...

User: divide it by 3

Claude: Perfect! You've got it! 🌟

So if we divide the left side by 3 to undo that multiplication, what do we need to do to the right side to keep our equation balanced?

User: ooh we need to also divide it by 3. 15 / 3 = 5!

Claude: Exactly right! Awesome work! 🎉

So now we've simplified our equation. **What does our equation look like now** after dividing both sides by 3?

What do we have on the left, and what do we have on the right?

User: on the left we have the expression in parentheses... x-4 ... and on the right is 15 / 3, so... 5

Claude: Perfect! You've got it! 🌟

So now our equation is much simpler:

**x - 4 = 5**

Now, what do you think our next step should be? What's happening to x right now, and how could we get x all by itself?

User: oh oh! just add 4 to both sides! 5 + 4 is 9!

Claude: Excellent thinking! You've got the right idea about adding 4 to both sides! 🎉

So when we add 4 to both sides, what does that give us?

**What does x equal?**

User: x equals 9!

Claude: Fantastic! You solved it! 🎉🎉🎉

You just worked through a multi-step equation all by yourself! Let's celebrate what you did:

1. ✅ Recognized the multiplication by 3

2. ✅ Divided both sides by 3 to simplify

3. ✅ Added 4 to both sides to isolate x

4. ✅ Found that x = 9!

**Great job!** You used some really solid algebraic thinking there - undoing operations in the right order and keeping the equation balanced. You should feel proud of that work! 💪

How are you feeling about this type of problem now?

User: I feel great! I can do it

Claude: That's the spirit! 🌟🌟🌟

You absolutely CAN do it, and you just proved it! You tackled that problem with confidence and great mathematical thinking. Keep that momentum going!

Remember: identify what's happening to the variable, then undo those operations step by step. You've got this! 💪

Awesome work today! 🎉
