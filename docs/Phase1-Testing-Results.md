## 🚀 QUICK START (Do This!)

1. **After each test conversation**, scroll down to find the last test problem section
2. **Copy this template** (just copy the whole "## Test Problem X" section below)
3. **Paste it** right after the last test problem
4. **Fill in:**
   - Problem name (e.g., "Test Problem 2: Distributive Property")
   - Problem text
   - Type
   - **Just paste the raw conversation** in the "Full Conversation" section (you can format it later!)
5. **Done!** Move on to the next test.

**That's it!** Don't worry about perfect formatting - just get the conversations logged. You can clean them up later.
