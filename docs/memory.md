*This document contains high-priority active context that every new chat must read carefully.*

Phase 2 is complete—time for Phase 3!
Right after you're done making file changes, I want you to run lint (`npm run lint` in root) and fix lint issues in the source code (but not in the markdown files), and then after that run build (`npm run build` in root) and fix any issues, and then after that, fix any `npm run test` issues.
Don't create a Markdown doc without asking me first — and default to just telling me in the chat the same information you were creating a file for, but also advise if the info is worth saving.
Commit your changes by default in a new chat, until I tell you to 'stop committing until I verify the fix', but you're allowed to resume committing your changes when I tell you we're in "implementation mode". Implementation mode (default) = commit; Troubleshooting mode = don't.
Refer to Architecture.md for application architecture when needed, and PRD.md when context around what we're building is needed
Do not read anything in docs/chat-logs/
